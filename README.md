# TI-Python
A versatile compiler to make TI-BASIC programs from Python 3 (with some restrictions)

## Installation
```
pip install ti-python
```

## Usage
**CLI**
```
python -m ti_python --help
```
or
```
ti-python --help
```
<br>

```
python -m ti_python examples/helloworld.py
```

**Python**
```py
from ti_python import compile
code = "print('Hello World!')"
print(compile(code))
```

See `examples/` for example programs

## Features
 - `print` and `input`
 - Integer and string variables (with multi-character names)
 - Basic arithmetic
 - Basic If statements
 - Comparisons
 - While loops
 - String operations

## Goals/To Do
 - Lists
 - Functions
 - Graphical output
 - More advanced comparisons and operations (exponents, roots, `and`, `or`)

Non-compiler related
 - 8XP encoding

## Restrictions
Your Python code still has to follow some restrictions due to the nature of the TI-BASIC.
 - Using `print` with commas will not insert spaces in-between 
 - The `input` function doesn't always return Strings, they can be numbers

These are known restrictions, but this compiler is still in development so of course you will still have *many* other issues
