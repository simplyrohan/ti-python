# ti-python
A versatile compiler to make TI-BASIC programs using Python 3 syntax (with some restrictions)

## Restrictions
Your Python code still has to follow some restrictions due to the nature of the TI-BASIC.
 - One letter variables names (this may be fixed soon)
 - Using `print` with commas will not insert spaces in-between
These are known and intentional restrictions, but this compiler is still in development so of course you will still have *many* problems
